<h4>THE DUTY AND IMPORTANCE OF SPECIAL EFFORTS FOR
THE CONVERSION OF CITIES.</h4>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Luke</span> xxiv. 47.&mdash;<i>And that repentance and remission of sins should be
preached in his name among all nations</i>, <span class="smcap">beginning at Jerusalem</span>.</p></div>


<p>Here the apostles receive from Christ a commission to commence
in one of the chief cities of the world the great business of preaching
the gospel to mankind. The fulfilment of prophecy required them to
begin at Jerusalem. "Out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the
word of the Lord from Jerusalem." "And it shall be in that day, that
living waters shall go out from Jerusalem." But there were other
and more special reasons. It was at Jerusalem that the death and resurrection
of the Son of God took place:&mdash;facts, on which Christianity
rested all its claims: and it was fit that the enemies of truth should
have every possible advantage for controverting those facts. In commencing
at Jerusalem, an immediate and striking illustration was also
afforded of the forgiving spirit of Christianity&mdash;'Go at once, and preach
unto these mine enemies repentance and remission of sins. Let them
have the opportunity of salvation through my blood&mdash;even that blood
which their own wicked hands have shed.'</p>

<p>This direction to the first preachers of the cross, to begin at Jerusalem,
suggests the general thought,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">That it becomes Christians, in all ages, to make special
efforts for the conversion of cities and large towns.</span></p>

<p>This thought may be illustrated and enforced, from the example and
instructions of Christ and his apostles; from the early and signal
visitations of the Spirit on cities; from the power with which Satan
reigns in them; and from their relative importance, and influence on
the world.<!-- Page 82 --></p>


<p>I. <i>Our Saviour devoted his personal ministry very much to cities
and large towns.</i></p>

<p>Says Matthew, "And it came to pass, when Jesus had made an end
of commanding his twelve disciples, he departed thence to teach and
to preach in their cities." Mark speaks of Him as follows: "And in
the morning, rising up a great while before day, he departed into a
solitary place, and there prayed: and Simon, and they that were with
him, followed after him. And when they had found him, they said
unto him, All men seek for thee. And he said unto them, Let us go
into the next towns, that I may preach there also: for therefore came
I forth." Luke informs us, that, on another occasion, He said unto
those who sought him, and who urged him that he should not depart
from them, "I must preach the kingdom of God to other cities also,
for therefore am I sent."</p>

<p>From many other passages of Scripture, also, we learn of Christ's
preaching in cities. "And behold, the whole city came out to meet
Jesus." "And all the city was moved, saying, Who is this?" "And
many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him." He is also
found in Jericho, and in Capernaum. His wonders are made known
at Chorazin and Bethsaida. His walks are along the shores, where
commerce and trade had congregated vast multitudes. Jerusalem he
repeatedly visits&mdash;especially on the anniversaries of religious festivals;
when his instructions might fall upon the ear of assembled thousands;
and through them be conveyed to every town and village of the land.
On one occasion, when he was come near to the city, "he beheld
and wept over it, saying, if thou hadst known, even thou, at least
in this thy day, the things which belong to thy peace; but now are
they hid from thine eyes.&mdash;Oh Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest
the prophets, and stonest them that are sent unto thee, how often
would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth
her chickens under her wings, and ye would not!" On another occasion,
it is said, "Then began he to upbraid the cities, wherein most
of his mighty works were done, because they repented not. Wo unto
thee, Chorazin; wo unto thee, Bethsaida; for if the mighty works
which were done in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they
would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. And thou
Capernaum, which art exalted unto heaven, shalt be brought down to
hell; for if the mighty works which have been done in thee, had been
done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day. But I say
unto you, that it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom, in the
day of judgment, than for thee." Thus it appears that the All-wise
Saviour thought it proper to devote much of his ministry to cities and
large towns.</p>

<p>II. <i>Christ, in his instructions to his disciples, particularly directs
their attention to cities and large towns.</i></p>

<p>"These twelve Jesus sent forth, and commanded them, saying,
Into whatsoever city or town ye shall enter, inquire who in it is worthy;
and there abide till ye go thence. And whosoever shall not receive
you, nor hear your words, when ye depart out of that house or city,
shake off the dust of your feet. Verily, I say unto you, it shall be
more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah, in the day of
judgment, than for that city." How solemn, yet well defined were
these instructions. How strongly must the twelve have been impressed
with the importance of special exertion in large towns and cities.
"After these things, the Lord appointed seventy also, and sent them
two and two before his face, into every city and place, whither he himself
would come. And he said unto them, Into whatsoever city ye
enter, and they receive you, eat such things as are set before you, and
heal the sick that are therein, and say unto them, the kingdom of God
is come nigh unto you. But into whatsoever city ye enter, and they
receive you not, go your ways out into the streets of the same, and
say, even the very dust of your city, which cleaveth on us, we do wipe
off against you. But I say unto you, it shall be more tolerable in that
day for Sodom and Gomorrah, than for that city." Wherefore should
so much stress be laid upon cities, unless it was peculiarly important
that they should be converted? And wherefore so heavy a curse,
unless the power of their example was great?</p>

<p>But still more particular and urgent are his instructions&mdash;The disciples,
when sent forth, were admonished that they would be "as sheep
in the midst of wolves;"&mdash;that they would be exposed to many
and severe trials. And surely, under such circumstances, human
nature would plead, that, when persecuted in the city, they might turn
to the less prejudiced inhabitants of the country. But no: the command
is, "When they persecute you in one city, flee ye into another;
for, verily, I say unto you, ye shall not have gone over the cities of
Israel, till the Son of Man be come."</p>

<p>It is true, that in the last great commission, in which the world was
spread before them as the field, every limitation was taken off, save
that they should begin at Jerusalem. Still the example of the apostles
is worthy of notice. For whilst several of them continued for years
in Jerusalem,&mdash;notwithstanding the persecutions which they experienced&mdash;others
went forth, and immediately preached the gospel of their
ascended Saviour in other great cities of the world.</p>

<p>Paul and Barnabas are found at Antioch, the capital of Pisidia.
From Antioch they went to Iconium, the metropolis of Lyconia.
Thence to Derbe, another city of Lyconia. In that embassy, they
also preached at Lystra, and Perga, and many other cities. Soon
after this, Paul said unto Barnabas, "Let us go again, and visit our
brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the Lord,
and see how they do." Paul expressed an ardent desire to be at Jerusalem
on the feast-days:&mdash;"For he hasted, if it were possible for
him, to be at Jerusalem, the day of Pentecost;" for then thousands of
strangers would be there assembled&mdash;"Parthians, Medes, and Elamites,
and the dwellers of Mesopotamia," and of many other places.
In Rome, too, that imperial city, did this apostle continue for two
years, preaching the gospel of Christ. There he established a Christian
church, to which he addressed the noblest epistle ever written.
Of Philip it is recorded, that "passing through, he preached in all the
cities, till he came to Cesarea." The apostles and disciples, then
directed their attention very particularly to cities.</p>

<p>III. <i>Cities were the theatres of the Holy Spirit's first and most illustrious
achievements.</i></p>

<p>Open the book of the Acts, and mark how and where the Spirit of
God accompanied the labours of the apostles. It was at Jerusalem,
the city whose million voices had just before demanded the death of
their Lord, and imprecated his blood upon their own heads, that the
first and greatest effusion of the Holy Spirit took place. <i>There</i> was
spiritual wickedness in high places. There iniquity was strongly intrenched.
The strong arm of the civil as well as ecclesiastical power
was its defence; and human calculation could look for no visits of
mercy. Still the Savior's command, to begin at Jerusalem, was
obeyed. Nor was it long before that city was filled with the presence
of the Most High&mdash;before the Spirit came down in power, and thousands
were converted to Christ.</p>

<p>But this is not a solitary case. At Antioch, also, the Spirit was
poured out. Indeed, there are two places of this name mentioned in
the Acts of the Apostles;&mdash;both visited in saving mercy. One, the
capital of Syria, a city of great note. It was about ten miles in circumference;
and, in population, wealth, and splendour, esteemed the
third city of the age. Here Paul and Barnabas preached. Here the
disciples were first called Christians. Here the Church continued long
to flourish. Here the eloquent Chrysostom, at the close of the fourth
century, preached with great power and success: and here the Holy
Spirit descended. "Now they, which were scattered abroad, upon
the persecution that arose about Stephen, travelled as far as Phenice,
and Cyprus, and Antioch, preaching the word to none but the Jews
only. And some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, which,
when they were come to Antioch, spake unto the Grecians, preaching
the Lord Jesus. And the hand of the Lord was with them: and a
great number believed and turned unto the Lord. Then tidings of
these things came unto the ears of the Church which was in Jerusalem;
and they sent forth Barnabas, that he should go as far as Antioch.
Who, when he came and had seen the grace of God, was glad, and
exhorted them all, that with purpose of heart they would cleave unto
the Lord." So great was this work, so important this field of usefulness,
that to secure the best assistance, "Barnabas departed to
Tarsus to seek Saul; and when he had found him, he brought him
unto Antioch. And it came to pass, that a whole year they assembled
themselves with the church, and taught much people." So powerful
was this work of God, as to demand, for a whole year, the special
labours of two of his most favoured servants.</p>

<p>The other Antioch, mentioned in the Acts, was the capital of Pisidia;
a place where many things opposed the advance of holiness.
But there also Paul and Barnabas laboured; and there souls were
born into the kingdom. The record is, "They came to Antioch, in
Pisidia, and went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day." And
Paul preached of Jesus and the resurrection, and faithfully warned
against lightly esteeming the work of God. "Beware, therefore, lest
that come upon you, which is spoken in the prophets: Behold, ye
despisers, and wonder, and perish; for I work a work in your days,
which ye shall in nowise believe though a man declare it unto you.
And when the Jews were gone out of the synagogue, the Gentiles besought
that these words might be preached unto them the next Sabbath.
And the next Sabbath day came almost the whole city together,
to hear the word of God. And when the Gentiles heard this,
they were glad, and glorified the word of the Lord; and as many as
were ordained to eternal life believed. And the word of the Lord
was published throughout all the region, and the disciples were filled
with joy and with the Holy Ghost."</p>

<p>Ephesus, too, was visited by the Holy Spirit. This was one of the
most famous cities of Asia Minor. By historians, it has been called
the ornament of Asia&mdash;the greatest and most frequented emporium of
the continent. Here stood one of the seven wonders of the world&mdash;the
idolatrous temple of Diana. Paul paid two visits to this city:
the first, a very short one. After some months, he returned, and continued
for three years, and had great success. Many things opposed
the influence of truth. Iniquity was deeply rooted: their established
religion was a source of revenue; and countenanced them in unhallowed
courses. But the Spirit of grace prevailed. The result was,
"that many that believed, came, and confessed, and showed their deeds.
Many of them, also, which used curious arts, brought their books together,
and burned them before all men. And they counted the price
of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver;" or, according
to our currency, nearly twenty-eight thousand dollars. Thus multitudes
made a public renunciation of idolatry, and a public profession
of their faith in Christ. "So mightily grew the word of God, and
prevailed."</p>

<p>The last city that we shall mention, as blessed with a revival, is
Corinth, the capital of Achaia. Here stood the temple of Venus; for
the support of whose costly and debasing services, a thousand human
victims were continually kept!&mdash;The multitude in this city were given
to a species of crime, most deadening to the conscience, and damning
to the soul. Yet all this did not discourage the intrepid apostle. For,
about the year of our Lord fifty-two, he came to Corinth, and "reasoned
in the synagogue every Sabbath day, and persuaded the Jews
and the Greeks." The persecuting spirit of the Jews was marshalled
against him. Yet he was successful, for <i>God was with him</i>. "Crispus,
the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord with all his
house; and many of the Corinthians, hearing, believed and were baptized.
Then spake the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, Be not
afraid, but speak, and hold not thy peace, for I am with thee, and no
man shall set on thee to hurt thee; for I have much people in this
city." And so great was the work, and so important the station, that
"he continued there a year and six months, teaching the word of God
among them." Here a large church was gathered, to which he addressed
two epistles.</p>

<p>We could mention other ancient cities as blessed with revivals. We
could tell you of Athens, the eye and glory of Greece; of Philippi, the
chief city of Macedonia; of Iconium, "where a great multitude, both
of the Jews and also of the Greeks, believed;" of Rome too, and
many others; but we forbear, since enough is already before you to
illustrate the position, that cities were the theatres of the Holy Spirit's
first and most illustrious achievements. Indeed, what is the book of
the Acts, but one continued history of revivals in cities and populous
places?</p>


<p>IV. <i>We should seek the conversion of Cities, because in them the
Adversary reigns with peculiar power.</i></p>

<p>Experienced Generals bend their most powerful forces against those
positions most strongly intrenched; well knowing, that if these are
subdued, the courage of the enemy is daunted, his plans marred, and
that what remains may fall an easy conquest. Why then should Christians
leave to Satan the quiet dominion of cities? He would rather
give up a thousand inland posts, than these strong holds of his empire.
But, Oh, could he be dislodged from these, how paralyzed would be his
arm&mdash;how feeble his resistance&mdash;how lost his influence! Would you
see the power of Satan in cities? Cast your eye back upon the past.
What were Sodom and Gomorrah? What were Tyre, and Sidon, and
Ninevah? What was Babylon? What was Jerusalem in its latter
days, when given up accursed of God? What were they, but sinks of
pollution and fountains of ruin? And could we draw aside the curtains
of darkness, what might we see in modern cities! Oh, the pollution,
and dark waters, that are open to the eye of God! Oh, the
thousand lures to vice! Oh, the frauds, the oppressions, the numberless
wrongs, which break down the integrity of the young; which
harden the middle-aged, and cover gray hairs with shame, and wretchedness,
and ruin! Oh, the dissipations, over which custom has thrown
an influence well nigh omnipotent! Oh, the tauntings, and the high
looks, the stiff neck, and the contemptuous sneer, with which wealth
and station conduct themselves towards the lowliness of Christian
meekness! Oh, the power that nerves itself against holiness! Wealth
and imposing splendour, eloquence and numbers, are in its ranks.
Perjury and cruel mockings are among its weapons. Oh, the chains
of darkness and gates of death, with which the strong man armed here
holds his prisoners! How loudly then do these demand the commiseration
and special effort of those, who would proclaim liberty to
the captives, and life to the dead! And for the encouragement of the
faithful, we add,</p>


<p>V. <i>There are peculiar advantages for the promotion of Religion
in cities.</i></p>

<p>God is wont to accompany the efforts of his people with special
grace, whenever they are exposed to extraordinary hazards. So,
where peculiar difficulties obstruct the advance of truth, there will also
be found other circumstances, which, if properly seized, will greatly
facilitate the work of reformation.</p>

<p>In cities, ministers and good men can readily and effectually co-operate
in plans of usefulness. The inhabitants of smaller towns and
villages are too scattered to allow of ready co-operation; but in our
cities, a few minutes may assemble many of those who love the Lord.
The dangers which threaten, or the hopes which gladden, quickly circulate.
The weakness of one portion may be readily sustained by the
greater strength of some other portion. In the multitude of professing
Christians, may be found men of wisdom, of wealth, of enterprise, of
leisure, of devotedness; all of whose varied gifts and talents may be
concentrated for good. Surely these are advantages peculiar to cities.
Too long have we looked upon the might of opposing interests, and
neglected the power which God hath given us. Too long have
churches stood alone, and feebly exerted their separate influences.
But in a union of the efforts of churches the increase of power may be
immense; for whilst "one shall chase a thousand, two shall put ten
thousand to flight."</p>

<p>It is by the means which cities afford for ready co-operation, that
Satan and his followers have in all ages achieved so much. <i>They</i>
make common cause. They suffer no differences to divide their
strength; knowing "that an house divided against itself cannot stand."
They combine their forces, in any plan which promises injury to the
Christian interest. Cities furnish to Christians the very same opportunities
for united effort, and thus present peculiar advantages.</p>

<p>Again, cities also furnish advantages for individual exertion.
Here a minister's influence may at once reach, not merely to
his own congregation, but far beyond. Every month he is brought in
contact with some thousands, who may be affected by his faithfulness.
And under his influence, many benevolent and pious institutions may
rise and shine to bless the world.</p>

<p>But it is not to ministers alone, that cities present large fields for
exertion. Private Christians also have abundant opportunities for usefulness.
In the walks of business, the influence of one inflexibly just
man is felt as far as his name is known. If Christians, in our cities,
would conduct themselves agreeably to the Bible, how awful to the
wicked would be their example! What reformations would be wrought
among the worldly and profane! How many haunts of poverty and
wretchedness would be searched out! How many souls, once in communion
with the saints, would be brought back from their wanderings!
How many children, rescued from vice, would be brought to the
Sabbath school; and there, perhaps, be taught of God to become
themselves angels of mercy! How many meetings for prayer and exhortation
would every week be sustained among the poor and the
wretched! How many of these degraded immortals might be rescued
from temporal and eternal darkness, to become lights in the world,
and stars in the kingdom of our Father's glory! What field then offers
so rich and large an harvest to faithful labour? The same exertion,
that would instruct hundreds in the country, may reach thousands in
the city. Public sentiment has too long checked the movements of
sympathy for these congregated thousands. A voice, almost unbroken,
has sounded out; 'Peculiar and insuperable difficulties prevent a
general revival in cities: such are the occupations, such the habits,
such the temptations, and such the superabounding iniquity, that it
were visionary to hope for any general and powerful work of mercy.'
Well, then, had we not better give all up; and let human nature here
sink into its natural channels; and let multitudes before our eyes continue
to crowd the gates of the second death! O God, forbid such
cowardice, cruelty, and treachery in thy servants! No; we will not
thus surrender immortals. While there is grace or even nature in our
hearts, we will not. We have, indeed, heard of difficulties, till the heart
is pained, and the soul is wearied. But where are these insuperable difficulties
to be found? Not in the Scriptures of God, surely; not in the
result of apostolic labours; but in the unbelief and inaction of modern
Christians. "God is no more hostile to cities than to villages: his
Spirit is as free, and his offers of salvation as full, to the people of the
crowded city, as of the open country." Let the advantages then be
embraced. Let the power be concentrated. Let the sacramental host
arise; and the work is done. And instead of being overwhelmed with
shame and deserved reproach, we may joyfully say to such as pass by;
"Walk about Zion, and go round about her: tell the towers thereof;
mark ye well her bulwarks, consider her palaces; that ye may tell it
to the generation following. For this God is our God for ever and
ever." "Then the sons also of them that afflicted Zion shall come
bending unto her; and all they that despised her shall bow themselves
down at the soles of her feet; and they shall call her the City of the
Lord&mdash;the Zion of the Holy One of Israel."</p>


<p>VI. <i>A sixth reason for special efforts in behalf of Cities is, the
influence which they exert on the country and on the world.</i></p>

<p>Look to any nation, whether ancient or modern; throw the map
before you; fix your eye upon the spots that bear rule; that command
the attention of the enterprising, and busy the thoughts of statesmen.
You have fixed it upon the cities of the world. Where was the
strength of Italy, if not in Rome, once mistress of the world? Where
the strength of Greece, if not in Athens, the mother of arts and
refinement? And where is the strength of our Republic, if not in our
cities and large towns? There talent in every art and profession is
fostered, and exerts peculiar influence. There wealth concentrates
its millions upon millions, to exert extensively a blasting or brightening
influence on society. There the press daily sends out its thousands
and its tens of thousands of winged messengers, to excite the passions,
to influence the opinions, to control the energies of a nation. Powerful
as is this engine, for corrupting or sanctifying the people, who does
not know that its munitions and magazines of strength are placed principally
in cities; and that the character which the press there sustains
is diffused throughout the land? In cities, commerce is concentrated.
The products of the soil flow from every county, town, and village, to
the cities; and thence they are distributed to the world. The riches,
the luxuries, the products of other climes and nations are brought to
cities, and thence distributed through the land. How manifest then,
that cities must exert a mighty influence on the country and on the
world. Who, that reflects on their extended intercourse, does not
know, that they regulate the prices of commodities; that their fashions
are imitated; that their maxims of trade are common law; and that
their moral habits and opinions, good or bad, have an influence on the
whole community? Their influence is great, whether we consider
them in a moral or political point of view. The capture of a city has
decided the destiny of nation. When Babylon was taken, a mighty
empire was given to the invader. When Jerusalem was vanquished,
all Judea was subdued. When ill-fated France was tossed with revolutions
and counter-revolutions, the possession of her metropolis gave
to either party the supreme command.</p>

<p>Now suppose that all this influence of cities is of a worldly, immoral,
irreligious character; what must be its blasting power on the general
interests of religion! It was when the pretended successor of Peter
established his authority in Rome, that that mystical Babylon became
"the mother of harlots," and "made the nations drunk with the wine
of the wrath of her fornications." And not until the angel shall "cry,
with a mighty and strong voice, <i>Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen</i>,"
will the strong man armed be vanquished, and the earth be encompassed
with glory. Not until the evil influence of cities shall be arrested,
will the mighty obstacles to the world's redemption be removed.
How immeasurably important then, that great efforts be made for their
conversion; and how merciful in God to destroy such of them as will
not repent. Oh, it was mercy infinite, that rained down fire upon
Sodom, and poured it heavily upon Gomorrah; and thus saved millions
from the contagion of their wickedness!</p>

<p>But suppose that all the influence of cities were of an heavenly character&mdash;suppose
the intelligence could be circulated along all our navigable
rivers and canals&mdash;suppose it could be communicated from village
to village, and from family to family, throughout the country, that
the Spirit of God, as on the day of Pentecost, had come down in awful
majesty and power among us; that all our men of business, and youth
of folly, had been arrested in their worldly career; that all our theatres
and resorts for vain pleasure had been forsaken; that our temples
were crowded and overflowing with devout worshippers, and anxious
inquirers; that the universal voice of our city's population had become,
What shall we do, that we may glorify God and extend his kingdom?
Suppose, I say, that this mighty change in our city could be told
throughout the country; who can estimate the overwhelming influence
it would carry along with it? Where is the solitary village that would
not feel the impulse, and have its eye and heart lifted to Heaven, in view
of the bright cloud of incense, ascending from these hundred temples,
and these thrice ten thousand family altars? And to extend our view
still further; suppose that every city of our land&mdash;that every city of the
world&mdash;should experience such a change; what almighty strength and
zeal would it give to the Angel having the everlasting Gospel to publish!
How soon would the universal acclamation of mankind be,
"Glory, and honour, and power be unto Him that sitteth upon the
throne!" And how soon would that blessed voice be heard from the
heaven of heavens, "The kingdoms of this world are become the
kingdoms of the Lord, and his Christ; and he shall reign for ever and
ever!"</p>

<p>These are not mere pictures of the imagination. The realities are
at hand. And the influence of cities, in introducing them, must be
felt. For "they of the city shall flourish like the grass of the earth."
"The name of the city from that day shall be, <i>The Lord is there</i>."
"Thus saith the Lord of hosts, it shall yet come to pass, that there
shall come people, and the inhabitants of many cities; and the inhabitants
of one city shall go to another, saying, let us go speedily to
pray before the Lord, and to seek the Lord of hosts." Thus the day
shall yet be, when the presence and power of the Holy God in cities
shall so absorb the affections, and command the energies of their inhabitants,
that, throughout the land, they shall be known and celebrated,
not for their wealth, their splendour, their numbers, or their
worldly enterprise, but <i>as the places where God has fixed his tabernacle</i>.
Yes, the day shall yet come when the intercourse between cities shall
be chiefly for purposes of religious improvement&mdash;when combinations
for political intrigue, or mercantile speculation, which now waken such
intensity of interest in our cities, shall dwindle to their comparative
nothingness; and when the world's redemption shall assume its proper
magnitude; and all be stimulated to more holy devotedness, and more
heavenly effort. Oh, what a day, when all our increasing facilities of intercourse
with the land, and with foreign nations, shall be used mainly
for advancing that kingdom which consists in righteousness and peace!&mdash;when
thousands shall prayerfully wait the arrival of every post, and
hail the coming in of every vessel, for intelligence, not of this world's
riches and glories, but of the glories and victories of Zion.</p>

<p>Such, however, is the present power of the adversary in cities, that
no ordinary effort will dispossess him. Still it must be done. The
triumph of the cross, the salvation of the world can never be perfected
without it. I know there are difficulties;&mdash;that cities do congregate
vast assemblies of active depravity;&mdash;that they present multiplied
enchantments to ruin;&mdash;that in every city wickedness displays
a stern and lofty front. But I also know, that before the coming Spirit
of God these obstacles shall melt away like wax, and vanish like
smoke; "for strong is his hand and high is his right hand."</p>

<p>It was when revivals prevailed in cities, that the gospel spread
with such amazing rapidity: and so, when the Spirit shall again descend
upon them, will the work of reformation move forward with such
power and grandeur, as shall make manifest that God is in Zion;
"that the chariots of God are twenty thousand, even thousands of
angels;" and that "the Lord is among them, as in Sinai, in the holy
place." Let all, then, who love Zion, seek for the reviving influences
of the Spirit upon cities. While every hand is faithful in the discharge
of duty, let every heart be impressed with the sentiment, <i>Not by might,
nor by power, but by my</i> <span class="smcap">Spirit</span>, <i>saith the Lord of hosts</i>; and let every
eye be directed to Him who hath promised, that <i>when iniquity cometh
in like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard</i>.</p>

<p>In urging the importance of special effort and prayer for the renovation
of cities, we do not overlook the interests of the country; but
would thus guard every town and village from an influence heavily impregnated
with moral poison and death. The merchants of the interior,
in the prosecution of their business, regularly visit the metropolis.
Many of them, on the enticement of friends and acquaintance,
attend the theatres, and other places of vain amusement and sin; they
become familiar with their glare and dissipation. They return, and tell
what their eyes have seen, and what their ears have heard, and thus
create in the bosom of the young, the ardent, the rich, and the worldly,
a thirst for similar pastimes, and a disrelish for sober realities. Many
faithful pastors in the land weep over the growing immoralities occasioned
by the influence of cities. Many churches lament the defection
of their members, having become worldly in their spirit, and vain
in their imaginations, by reason of their frequent intercourse with cities.
If such, then, is their influence upon the country, well may the
churches, planted throughout the land, feel deeply interested in the
moral character of cities, and pray for their conversion to God.</p>

<p>Let our cities become places of holiness: let holiness to the Lord
be written upon the heart of every merchant, of every mechanic, of
every statesman, of every counsellor, of every officer, upon every hall
of legislation, and every splendid edifice; and an influence sweet, holy,
and happy, shall go forth to revive the hearts of God's people, to awe
and confound opposers, and to dress up the wilderness "like the garden
of God."</p>

<p>O, what a scene of grandeur and glory, when the thousands of the
saints shall wrestle in the spirit of Jacob for the blessing: when they
shall rise up in the spirit of their Master, and display an untiring zeal
for the salvation of man! O, what a scene, when the immense
crowds of immortal beings, who throng our streets, shall be deeply
impressed with the conviction of their accountability!&mdash;When every
man shall feel that he is acting continually under the eye of God, and
in full prospect of the judgment. Let these scenes be realized, and
already I see "the holy city, the new Jerusalem, coming down from
God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband."
And I hear "a great voice out of heaven, saying, Behold, the tabernacle
of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall
be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God."</p>

<p>Friends of the Redeemer, the hastening of this blessed consummation
depends very much upon your will. God has intrusted great power
in your hands. In the revelation of his Son, he has given you that
word, which is "as a fire, and like a hammer, that breaketh the rock in
pieces." In shedding down a spirit of union, and guiding to the
formation of great benevolent associations, he has given you facilities
for extended influence hitherto unparalleled. He has given you
wealth, and knowledge, and all the means for using these facilities.
And in the article of prayer, he has endued you with a power well
nigh omnipotent. His condescending language is, "Concerning the
work of my hands <span class="smcap">command ye me</span>." I see among you men of
wealth, who can count your tens, your fifties, and your hundreds of
thousands,&mdash;all of which has been solemnly consecrated to God. I
see among you men of talent,&mdash;"capable of intimidating the collective
vices of a nation or an age." I see among you men of enterprise,
and courage, and resistless perseverance. I see among you men,
who have strong confidence in God. And shall these varied powers
of resistance and aggression be circumscribed by the walls of individual
churches? Shall they not rather be combined for raising a higher and
higher tone of moral feeling, and Christian enterprise? Shall they not
send a strong, concentrated light into every dark retreat of wickedness?
Shall not the tide of dissipation, and crime, that would overflow and
mar every thing sacred, be met and turned back? Shall not thousands
and tens of thousands on our borders, and in our midst, be rescued
from the iron sway of the destroyer, and be saved from going down to
the pit? Shall not new temples be opened for their reception? and
shall not "God, even our God, be a wall of fire round about them, and
a glory in the midst of them?"</p>

<p>Do you ask more particularly, how this shall be done? Plant,
for instance, an able and devoted minister in the most degraded
portion of our city. Let him employ his time in the cultivation
of one thousand of these minds. Let him, by the aid of self-denying
brethren, assemble them in one place on the holy sabbath.
Let him visit their houses, and pray with them, every month.
Let him collect the children and youth into sabbath schools and bible
classes. Let him encourage among them every means of intellectual
as well as spiritual elevation; and how astonishing will be the change
wrought, even in the course of one year. Instead of being objects of
pity, shame, and aversion; many of them become pillars of light, and
exert a purifying influence upon others. Is not this elevation worth
more than all the necessary expense, even leaving out of the account
all the eternal results? Let, then, another and another degraded
portion be selected, and in like manner be regenerated and ennobled.
Especially let no one who feeds at the table of our common Lord,
and lives from week to week on the provisions of his house, refuse,
promptly and vigorously to co-operate in the work of mercy, while a
soul is perishing in ignorance and sin!</p>

<p>In the mean time, let our civil fathers look well to the execution of
laws, which themselves have made, for the suppression of sabbath-breaking
and immorality. And let them inquire seriously, Whether
all our children and youth may not be brought under the influence of
instructors of good character, and other moral restraints, a thousand-fold
more efficacious, for preventing crime, than statutes, and prisons, and
chains.</p>

<p>Our hearts rejoice to see new blocks of buildings going up to decorate
our city. But what is that to the present and eternal elevation of these
thousand minds? Should we not then exult in the privilege of lifting
all the degraded portions of our city, and of our land, into intellectual
and moral grandeur? What object of ambition could there be, equal to
that of thus creating an empire of righteousness&mdash;a world of intellect?
Such monuments of glory shall remain, when earthly governments
shall be no more, and the earth itself shall have passed away.</p>

<p>Never, methinks, was the language of God more distinct, than at
the present crisis. To the rich he is manifestly saying, "Bring ye all
the tithes into the store-house, that there may be meat in my house,
and prove me now herewith, if I will not open you the windows of
heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room
enough to receive it. And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes;
and all nations shall call you blessed." To the ministers of religion,
and to all his chosen, he is manifestly saying, "O Zion, that bringest
good tidings, get thee up into the high mountain: O Jerusalem, that
bringest good tidings, lift up thy voice with strength; lift it up; be not
afraid; say unto the cities; Behold your God! Behold the Lord God
will come with strong hand, and his arm shall rule for him: behold,
his reward is with him, and his work before him." "When the Lord
shall build up Zion, he shall appear in his glory. He will regard the
prayer of the destitute, and not despise their prayer. This shall be
written for the generation to come: and the people which shall be
created, shall praise the Lord. For he hath looked down from the
height of his sanctuary, to hear the groaning of the prisoner; to loose
those that are appointed to death; to declare the name of the Lord
in Zion, and his praise in Jerusalem."</p>

<p>These are great privileges for God to confer on such worms as we
are. Yet God has indeed placed them within reach. And if we will
but do our duty here, we are only ripening for infinitely greater privileges
and higher honours. He that is <i>faithful over a few things</i>,
shall be made <i>ruler over many things</i>. Yes; when all our cities,
and the earth itself, and these heavens shall be "wrapt in consuming
fire," we may, "with the great multitude found faithful," enter that <i>City,
which hath foundations, whose Builder and Maker is God</i>. In <i>that</i>
City, "<span class="smcap">there shall be no more curse, but the throne of God and
the Lamb shall be in it, and his servants shall serve him.
And there shall be no night there; and they need no candle,
neither light of the sun; for the Lord God giveth them
light: and they shall reign for ever and ever</span>."</p>

<h2><a name="APPENDIX" id="APPENDIX"></a>APPENDIX.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> population of New-York city, in 1820, was 123,706. In
1825, it was 166,086: making an increase, in 5 years, of 42,380.
Allowing the same ratio of increase, there is now a population of
185,000. There are in the city 101 churches, or houses of public
worship: Of which 4 are Roman Catholic, 1 New-Jerusalem, 2 Unitarian,
2 Universalist, 2 Jews' Synagogues, 15 Baptist, 13 Methodist,
17 Episcopalian, and 34 Presbyterian churches, including the Scotch
and Reformed Dutch. The remainder are Lutheran, Moravian,
Friends, German Reformed, and Independents. The average number
of regular attendants is estimated, by such as have made it a subject
of special examination, not to exceed 400 to each house; which
makes the number of those statedly attending public worship 40,400.
After deducting 50,000, for children, for the sick, and for others
necessarily absent, there will still remain <span class="smcap">Ninety-Four Thousand and
Six Hundred</span>, or <i>more than half the population, absenting themselves
from the public worship of God!</i></p>

<p>There are in the city 4 theatres and 2 circuses: most of which are
opened from 4 to 6 nights every week. The number of shops and
other places licensed to sell liquor by the small measure, is three
thousand; or about one to every <span class="smcap">seventh dwelling-house</span>! In
addition to the violations of holy time, occasioned by steam-boats, and
other public conveyances, by butchers, grocers, and other traders purchasing
their stock from boats arriving from the country, upwards of
<span class="smcap">One Thousand</span> <i>shops, and other places, are opened for the sale of
liquor or other things on the Sabbath</i>!</p>

<p>Nor is this view peculiar to New-York. A critical investigation of
facts in other cities will develop similar results. In London, the
whole number of churches and chapels of all denominations is estimated
at 400. "If we calculate," says a late English writer, "that
the average attendance is 500; which is certainly the greatest extent
we can allow, and add 250 more for the fluctuating hearers, it will
give a result of 300,000 persons. The population of this metropolis
is estimated at 1,274,800. From which subtract the feeble minority
above, and we find <span class="smcap">Nine Hundred and Seventy-Four Thousand
Eight Hundred</span> <i>persons neglecting the public worship of God</i>! It
appears that of the commercial papers published in London on the
Sunday, there are circulated, on the lowest estimate, 45,000 copies;
and that upon the most moderate computation, between two and three
hundred thousand readers of these papers are to be found in the metropolis
alone. While the great number of pressmen, distributers,
master-venders, hawkers, and subordinate agents, of both sexes, and
of all ages, who are employed on the Sabbath, all tend to the most
flagrant breach of the day of rest."</p>

<p>In the mean time, the number of deaths in New-York is about <i>five
thousand</i> annually: in London, about <i>thirty-three thousand</i>.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
